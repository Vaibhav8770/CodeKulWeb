        <h1>Blizzard unveils plans for World of Warcraft esports in 2021</h1>
        <img src="https://cdn1.dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/31160158/17628-shadowlands-craft-your-own-custom-legendary-in-the-forge-of-domination-1536x864.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Blizzard showcased today what it has in store for World of Warcraft esports next year.Starting from a foundation of what 2020 has offered, the tournament system will be adjusted worldwide to ensure that the best players in both PvP and PvE gameplay
            have lots of opportunities to show everyone what they’re made off.</p>
        <h2>Arena World Championship</h2>
        <p>With the launch of the 14th year of the Arena World Championship, Blizzard is expanding to two seasons of epic PvP competition. In 2021, the AWC will consist of two seasons culminating in the AWC: Shadowlands 2021 Grand Finals next fall. A $900,000
            total prize pool will be up for grabs for the year.

        <h2>Season One</h2>
        <p>Beginning today, teams in North America and Europe can sign up on GameBattles for the season one open cups. In addition to a $10,000 prize pool per cup, teams will be competing for points. The top eight point-earning teams from both North America
            and Europe will advance to the circuit following the conclusion of all four cups.</p>
        <p>The circuit will consist of a four-week round robin and a $160,000 total prize pool. Following the circuit, the top-four teams from each region will earn their spots in the season one finals and a shot at the $200,000 prize pool.</p>
        <h2>Season Two</h2>
        <p>Once the season one champions have been crowned, it’ll be time to set the stage for season two. Instead of another series of open cups, the top-six regional teams from the season one circuit will automatically advance to the season two circuit,
            while the remaining spots will be filled through an open relegation cup. The relegation cup will consist of the bottom two teams from the North American and European season one circuit, battling against an open field of competitors looking
            to secure a slot in season two. The top-two teams from each region at the end of the cup will advance to the season two circuit.</p>
        <p>Like in season one, the remaining teams in North America and Europe will be fighting for their share of the $160,000 total prize pool and one of the four regional slots in the finals. The final teams to advance will battle for the expanded $300,000
            prize pool and to cement their names as the AWC: Shadowlands 2021 Grand Finals champions.</p>
